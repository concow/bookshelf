# Bookshelf

Bookshelf is a virtual book inventory.

The app uses a local database to store book data, changes, and submissions.

User Events:

- A user can add a new book.
    - Give properties: Title, Author, Genre, Price, and submit an Image
- Like an existing book in the inventory.
- Delete an existing book in the inventory.

Submitting a new book, or deleting a book in the inventory will persist and make permanent changes to your database.
